# Changelog

## 3.0.0

### Breaking

- **`GET /tenancy/member/:id` (`getMember`)** now returns a reduced `user`
  projection `{ id, name, image }` instead of the full user row. Consumers
  reading other user fields (e.g. `user.email`) must fetch them separately.
  This matches the projection already used by add/list/update member and
  avoids leaking sensitive user fields.

### Added

- **`listPermissionContexts`** endpoint (`GET /tenancy/permission/contexts`,
  client `authClient.tenancy.permission.listPermissionContexts`): lists the
  organizations/teams a user has access to, with `parentType`/`parentId`
  hierarchy. Self-only by default; the `endpoints.permission.contexts` hook is
  the admin override for cross-user lookups. Optional `statementId` filters to
  contexts where that permission resolves to allowed.
- OpenAPI `200`/`201`/`204` response schemas documented for every endpoint.
